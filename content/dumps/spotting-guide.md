# The Hell Let Loose Spotting Guide
Ever had trouble identifying what is dropping in the sky or what tank just killed you? Then this guide is for you!
We will go over most of the objects that live in Hell Let Loose, so you can identify them when you see them in the wild.

We will start off with the objects that are the same for all the factions, and after that we will go over the faction-specific objects.

# Some Thoughts
- Airdrops can be hard to identify from far away, use binos or aim at the drop with your gun.
- All tanks have different camos/colors, once you get familiar with them you can identify different tanks very quickly.

# Global Objects (Not faction specific)
## Drops
### Airhead
All airheads are made the same. It will always be a red parachute with a square box.

# Faction Specific Objects
## Drops
### Supply Drop
There is currently two types of supply drops in the game, one for the axis and one for the allies.
The easiest way to spot if a supply drop is a friendly is by the color of the parachute. 
An allied supply drop will have a white parachute, and an axis supply drop will have a red parachute.

If it's a red parachute make sure you check the shape of the drop to rule out an airhead.
The german supply drop will look like a rocket.

## Tanks
### Recon Vehicles

### Light Tanks
There's currently only two light tanks in the game, the American Stuart and the German Luchs.
### Medium Tanks
#### T-34
#### Panzer-IV
#### M4A3 Sherman 
> Make sure you call it out as a sherman MEDIUM to avoid confusion. If you only say sherman it could still be one of the US heavy tanks. 
### Heavy Tanks
Heavy tanks generally easier to spot because they are the biggest, but identifying the type can is equally important since there are two heavy tanks for USA and Axis.
#### Russian IS-1
The Russian IS-1 can be identified by its very long barrel and its blocky front shape. The T-34 is a bit more rounded, and has an angled front plate.
#### Axis tanks
The germans have both the Tiger and the Panther, two very different tanks with very different playstyles.
The Tiger is the biggest tank in the game, and is very boxy. The Panther is a bit smaller and has angled armour.
#### US Tanks
> You can keep your callout short by simply calling these tanks out as either a 75 or a 76

On the US side you have two very similar heavy tanks, the Jumbo 75mm and the Jumbo 76mm. 
The most common ways to distinguish between them is either the color or the size of the barrel. 
The 76mm has a very long barrel with a muzzle break at the end. The 75mm is missing the muzzle break and is a different color of green.
## Light vehicles
### Half-Tracks
> If the engine is off, it can be used as a spawnpoint. You can lock it by standing within 15m of it.

Generally half-tracks are easy to spot, but very important to call out. You wouldn't want one sneaking around behind your lines.

### Supply Trucks

### Transport Trucks

# Other less important stuff
## Planes
All different drops and airstrikes can be identified by sound and type of plane. 
If correctly identified it can allow you to anticipate earlier for what is coming (ex. bombing runs, strafing runs).
